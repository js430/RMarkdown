For this report, I have chosen to analyze a dataset on players available in FIFA 2019.
```{r}
fifa<-read.csv("data.csv")
```
This dataset is very large, with 89 columns, some of which are not needed, specifically Photo and Flag. First, I will clean up the dataset to only relevant/important data. 
```{r}
drops<-c("Photo", "Flag", "Club.logo" )
head(fifa[ ,!(names(fifa) %in% drops)][,1:6])
```
Looking at just the first few rows we notice something interesting about the ID of each player. All except for Christiano Ronaldo's is a six digit number. Christiano Ronaldo's is a 5 digit. Taking a look at some statistics about the ID number:
```{r}
max(fifa$ID)
min(fifa$ID)
minimum<-match(min(fifa$ID), fifa$ID)
minimum
```
